# MozaWave Enterprise Security Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security implementation for MozaWave, an enterprise-grade SaaS intelligence platform for SMBs. The security measures are designed to meet enterprise standards and protect sensitive business intelligence data.

## Security Architecture

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-based authentication** with short expiry (15 minutes)
- **Refresh token rotation** for enhanced security
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** with hierarchical permissions
- **Multi-factor authentication** support
- **OAuth 2.0** integration with least-privilege scopes

### 2. Data Protection
- **End-to-end encryption** for sensitive data
- **Tenant isolation** at database level
- **Data anonymization** for analytics
- **Secure token storage** with encryption
- **Regular security audits** and penetration testing

### 3. Network Security
- **HTTPS enforcement** with HSTS
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)** implementation
- **Rate limiting** per tenant and IP
- **DDoS protection** via Cloudflare
- **VPN access** for admin operations

## Secret Management

### Environment Variables
Store all sensitive configuration in environment variables:

```bash
# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-jwt-secret-here
JWT_EXPIRY=15m
REFRESH_EXPIRY=7d

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database

# OAuth Providers
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
YELP_CLIENT_ID=your-yelp-client-id
YELP_CLIENT_SECRET=your-yelp-client-secret
TWITTER_CLIENT_ID=your-twitter-client-id
TWITTER_CLIENT_SECRET=your-twitter-client-secret

# External APIs
GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY=your-google-cloud-api-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# Redis
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Email
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-sendgrid-api-key
SES_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-ses-access-key
SES_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-ses-secret-key
```

### Vercel Environment Variables
Configure in Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to Project Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add all required variables for Production, Preview, and Development
3. Use different secrets for each environment
4. Enable "Protect" for sensitive variables

### AWS Secrets Manager (Recommended for Production)
```bash
# Store secrets in AWS Secrets Manager
aws secretsmanager create-secret \
  --name "mozawave/production/jwt-secret" \
  --description "JWT signing secret for MozaWave production" \
  --secret-string "your-super-secure-jwt-secret"

# Retrieve in application
const secret = await secretsManager.getSecretValue({
  SecretId: 'mozawave/production/jwt-secret'
}).promise();
```

## Database Security

### Tenant Isolation
All database queries MUST include tenant_id for isolation:

```sql
-- ✅ CORRECT: Tenant-isolated query
SELECT * FROM competitors WHERE tenant_id = $1 AND deleted_at IS NULL;

-- ❌ WRONG: Missing tenant isolation
SELECT * FROM competitors WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
```

### Encryption at Rest
- **Database encryption** enabled
- **Backup encryption** with AES-256
- **Connection encryption** via SSL/TLS
- **Key rotation** every 90 days

### Backup & Restore
```bash
# Encrypted backup
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL | gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 > backup.sql.gpg

# Restore from encrypted backup
gpg --decrypt backup.sql.gpg | psql $DATABASE_URL
```

## Audit Logging

### Audit Log Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  tenant_id UUID NOT NULL,
  user_id UUID,
  event_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  resource_type VARCHAR(50),
  resource_id UUID,
  action VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  details JSONB,
  ip_address INET,
  user_agent TEXT,
  timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_tenant_id ON audit_logs(tenant_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_timestamp ON audit_logs(timestamp);
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_event_type ON audit_logs(event_type);
```

### Sample Audit Queries
```sql
-- Security events in last 24 hours
SELECT event_type, COUNT(*) as count
FROM audit_logs
WHERE timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
  AND event_type LIKE '%security%'
GROUP BY event_type
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- User activity by tenant
SELECT tenant_id, user_id, COUNT(*) as actions
FROM audit_logs
WHERE timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY tenant_id, user_id
ORDER BY actions DESC;

-- Failed authentication attempts
SELECT ip_address, COUNT(*) as attempts
FROM audit_logs
WHERE event_type = 'authentication_failed'
  AND timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY ip_address
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
ORDER BY attempts DESC;
```
